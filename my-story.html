            <p>I grew up in sunny Italy, surrounded by the world of gymnastics thanks to my family's club. As soon as I could, I joined in and started helping out. Later on, I pursued my love for creativity and graduated in fashion design. In 2014, I decided to spice things up and embarked on an adventure by moving to Ireland. I was on a mission to discover new opportunities and carve out my career path. And guess what? I stumbled upon SAAS support! Despite having the tech skills of a floppy disk, I geeked out over the thrill of problem-solving and troubleshooting. It was love at first KB (get it?). I had some wild attempts at self-learning technologies like app development and Python, but I struggled to find my groove. But hey, life took me to Australia in 2018, and I found myself falling in love with the industry all over again! Luck must've had a crush on me because that's when fate introduced me to the SheCodes Plus coding boot camp. With a much prized scholarship spot, I dove headfirst into coding, ready to take on even more mind-bending puzzles. Now, armed with my newly acquired skills, I'm eager to put them to work at a company that shares my values and offers a product I can genuinely be proud to support. I believe in continuous growth, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the tech world.</p>
