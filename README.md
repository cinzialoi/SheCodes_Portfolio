SheCodes Portfolio ( https://cinzialoi.github.io/SheCodes_Portfolio/index.html )

## Project Requirements

### Content
This portfolio has been built as the first project for SheCodes.
It has been built as a platform to host the projects that will be delivered througout the course and as my very first dev portfolio.
It has been built to allow me to showcase my work (my work page), to provide a bit of background about myself and my journey (my story) and to give guests a mean to connect with me via social and/or contact form (Get in touch).

- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form

### Technical
The project guidelines required at least two pages. I preferred further compartmentalizing my content in more than two and ended up with 4: Home, My work, My Story, Contact. Note that users can reach some areas/contents via multiple links.
